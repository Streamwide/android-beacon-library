/**
 * This filter calculates its rssi on base of an auto regressive moving average (ARMA)
 * It needs only the current value to do this; the general formula is  n(t) = n(t-1) - c * (n(t-1) - n(t))
 * where c is a coefficient, that denotes the smoothness - the lower the value, the smoother the average
 * Note: a smoother average needs longer to "settle down"
 * Note: For signals, that change rather frequently (say, 1Hz or faster) and tend to vary more a recommended
 * value would be 0,1 (that means the actual value is changed by 10% of the difference between the
 * actual measurement and the actual average)
 * For signals at lower rates (10Hz) a value of 0.25 to 0.5 would be appropriate
